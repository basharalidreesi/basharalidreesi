The exhibition's planning had begun in 1912 and its construction in early 1914. By that time, the Deutscher Werkbund had become at the forefront of Germany's project for modernity and industrialism. <i>Vom Sofakissen zum Städtebau</i>, the time had now come for the Deutscher Werkbund to announce itself with a grandiose exhibition. As forerunners of the Bauhaus, the Deutscher Werkbund’s band of architects had taken it upon themselves to dissolve the boundaries between the notion of <em>Art</em> as experienced or imagined by many and the notion of <em>Industry</em>. Painting, sculpture, architecture, and city planning were to become one and the same. Against this background, it comes to no surprise that the Deutscher Werkbund never proclaimed itself an artistic movement. A simple look at a few key buildings from the exhibition, however, begs the question of <q><i>what, then, is art?</i></q> and, by extension, <q><i>what is architecture?</i></q>.</p>

                        <p>This essay looks at Bruno Taut’s exhibited <i>Glashaus</i>, a grand palace of glass, gold, silver, water, and precious stone.</p>

                        <p><q>The <i>Glashaus</i></q>, Bruno Taut had proclaimed, <q>has no purpose other than to be beautiful</q>. Objectively, the <i>Glashaus</i> was an impressive manifestation of the glass industry. Commissioned by the Luxfer Prism Glass Company, it utilised the company’s newly-patented system of structural glazing of <dfn>Glaseisenbeton</dfn>, which came to be known as the Keppler System. Yet, to Bruno Taut, it was an edifice of Architecture. In an article titled <i>Eine Notwendigkeit (A Necessity)</i>, Bruno Taut expressed why he thought the <i>Glashaus</i> and what it represented were absolutely necessary. Upon its construction, the <i>Glashaus</i> was inscribed with a line of prose that sought the same.</p>

                        <blockquote style="text-align: center; width: max-content;">
                                <p>Glass brings a new era</p>
                                <p>Building in brick only does us harm</p>
                                <p>Without a glass palace life is a burden</p>
                                <p>Coloured glass destroys hatred</p>
                                <p>Light seeks to penetrate the whole cosmos,</p>
                                <p>and is alive in the crystal.</p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>With these words the <i>Glashaus</i> announced itself as the pinnacle of a long tradition of glass architecture. This <em>Glass Architecture</em>, as declared in an exhibition pamphlet by Bruno Taut, was preluded by the gothic cathedral. The gothic cathedral, with its <q>inappropriate nave and even less practical tower</q>, appealed to Bruno Taut as a declaration of the purpose of architecture. The purpose of architecture and the purpose of design, he thought, is more than the fulfilment of mere basic necessities: <q>To view architecture as nothing more than nicely-designed functional forms or as ornamental wrappings around our essential needs</q>, he says, <q>is to assign it the role of a craft and places too little value on its importance in our lives</q>. <q>Only when human desire goes beyond the satisfaction of mere functional needs...</q>, and, <q>...where people desire an abundance of luxury, does architecture seem to be more noticeable and reveal more of itself</q>.</p>

                        <p>It is easy to misinterpret this as a call of materialist impetus, but the <i>Tautist</i> path to Expressionism is far more religious than frivolous: The role of architecture, for Bruno Taut, is to be a mirror for man. To understand this, it is immediately important to differentiate between <em>Architecture</em> and <em>building</em>, and consequently between <em>Architecture, the Art</em>, and <em>architecture, the craft</em>: Where <em>Architecture</em> should assume the role of <em>art</em>, <em>building</em> assumes the role of <em>craft</em>. This conception of architecture gives this term, <em>Architecture</em>, a different meaning, a different purpose, and most importantly an increased need to define and identify it.</p>

                                <p>PEOPLES OF EUROPE! CREATE FOR YOURSELF SACRED POSSESSIONS—BUILD!</p>
                                <p>The Monte Rosa and its foothills down to the green plains is to be rebuilt. Yes, impractical and without utility! But have we become happy through utility? Always utility and utility, comfort, convenience— good food, culture—knife, fork, trains, toilets, and yet also—cannons, bombs, instruments of murder! To want only the utilitarian and comfortable without higher ideals is boredom. Boredom brings quarrel, stride, and war... Preach the social idea... Engage the masses in a great task, which fulfils everyone, from the humblest to the foremost...Each sees in the great communality clearly the work of his own hands: each builds—in the true sense...</p>

                        <p><i>Architecture</i>, he says, <i>whose glory shall be praised many thousand times</i>, is to be found in buildings that represent not their mere functional necessities, but our highest values we associate these buildings with. <q>For all times</q>, he says, <q>we have gravitated to the house of God as the one building that can convey our deepest feelings about mankind and the world</q>. Religious architecture, represented in Europe by the cathedral, is the material expression to God and, as such, is exemplary to architecture: The cathedral is not a practical building nor should it try to be: The purposelessness of the cathedral grants it significance and right to reign powerfully over our cities and, as such, the cathedral remains the true <i>crown of the city</i>. <q>...architecture</q>, he says, <q>only arises if it emerges from a story</q>. Still, Bruno Taut makes it his point that granting city administration buildings significance is foreign to our modern feelings, yet that the national thought during the rise of nationalistic feelings could be a suitable expression of the highest building will. This <i>Nietzsche-esque</i> philosophy of the highest building will is key to understanding Tautist Expressionism. <q>If the architect does not want to become unnecessary</q>, he states, <q>he will have to design the crown of the city</q>. <q>Furthermore, if we do not know the element that feeds all small waters, we will not know the reason to make this little house or that building beautiful!</q>. Bruno Taut continues to make it his point that <q>the lack of this knowledge is why architecture is so poorly-appreciated today</q>: This unawareness of <q>the great element that feeds all small waters</q> as narrated in Nietzsche’s Parable of the Madman — that <q>God is dead</q>, that <q>God remains dead</q>, and that <q>we have killed him</q> — is seen in the absence of the church in contemporary conceptions of the city. <q>The common prayer and liturgy have lost their unifying power</q>: The cathedral may no longer claim right to crown our cities. Yet, a higher thought must always be present, and in contemporaneous nations it was no longer one of religion, but one of socialism as <q>the word that promises a new form of Christianity</q>. <q>Socialism, in its non-political sense</q>, he states, <q>means freedom from every form of authority as a simple, ordinary connection between people and it bridges any gap between fighting classes and nations to unite humanity. If one philosophy can crown the city of today, it is an expression of these thoughts</q>.</p>
