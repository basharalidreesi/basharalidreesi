<p>In May of 1914 at the Rheinpark in Cologne, Henry van de Velde inaugurated the Deutscher Werkbund’s first exhibition held in response to Konrad Adenauer's call. The exhibition's planning had begun in 1912 and its construction in early 1914. By that time, the Deutscher Werkbund had become at the forefront of Germany's project for modernity and industrialism. <i>Vom Sofakissen zum Städtebau</i>, the time had now come for the Deutscher Werkbund to announce itself with a grandiose exhibition. As forerunners of the Bauhaus, the Deutscher Werkbund’s band of architects had taken it upon themselves to dissolve the boundaries between the notion of <em>Art</em> as experienced or imagined by many and the notion of <em>Industry</em>. Painting, sculpture, architecture, and city planning were to become one and the same. Against this background, it comes to no surprise that the Deutscher Werkbund never proclaimed itself an artistic movement. A simple look at a few key buildings from the exhibition, however, begs the question of <q><i>what, then, is art?</i></q> and, by extension, <q><i>what is architecture?</i></q>. This essay looks at Bruno Taut’s exhibited <i>Glashaus</i>, a grand palace of glass, gold, silver, water, and precious stone.</p>

<p><q>The <i>Glashaus</i></q>, Bruno Taut had proclaimed, <q>has no purpose other than to be beautiful</q>. Objectively, the <i>Glashaus</i> was an impressive manifestation of the glass industry. Commissioned by the Luxfer Prism Glass Company, it utilised the company’s newly-patented system of structural glazing of <dfn>Glaseisenbeton</dfn>, which came to be known as the Keppler System. Yet, to Bruno Taut, it was an edifice of Architecture. In an article titled <i>Eine Notwendigkeit</i>, Bruno Taut expressed why he thought the <i>Glashaus</i> and what it represented were absolutely necessary. Upon its construction, the <i>Glashaus</i> was inscribed with a line of prose that sought the same.</p>

<p><q>Glass brings a new era; building in brick only does us harm <br /> Without a glass palace life is a burden <br /> Coloured glass destroys hatred <br /> Light seeks to penetrate the whole cosmos and is alive in the crystal.</q></p>
