- title: To really appreciate architecture, you may even need to commit a murder
  figure: https://source.unsplash.com/random/100x100
  caption: Architecture is defined by the actions it witnesses as much as by the enclosure of its walls. Murder in the Street differs from Murder in the Cathedral in the same way as love in the street differs from the Street of Love. Radically.

- title: Sensuality has been known to overcome even the most rational of buildings.
  figure: https://source.unsplash.com/random/600x500
  caption: Architecture is the ultimate erotic act. Carry it to excess and it will reveal both the traces of reason and the sensual experience of space. Simultaneously.
  type: "11"

- title: The most architectural thing about this building is the state of decay in which it is.
  figure: https://source.unsplash.com/random/600x500
  caption: Architecture only survives where it negates the form that society expects of it. Where it negates itself by transgressing the limits that history has set for it.

- title: common ground?
  figure: https://source.unsplash.com/random/200x100
  caption: Architecture is not so much about the conditions of design but about the design of conditions.

- title: common ground?

  caption: figure/ground
  subtitle: Architecture is not so much the knowledge of form, but a form of knowledge.
  type: "14"
- title: common ground?
  figure: https://source.unsplash.com/random/160x100
  subtitle: Concept, not form is what distinguishes architecture from mere building.
  figure2: "https://source.unsplash.com/random/160x100"
  caption: commonplace
  type: "15"
- figure: https://source.unsplash.com/random/200x100
  caption: "Look at it this way: <br /> The game of architecture is an intricate play with rules that you may break or accept. These rules, like so many knots that cannot be untied, have the erotic significance of bondage: the more numerous and sophisticated the restraints, the greater the pleasure."
  title: ropes and rules
  subtitle: The most excessive passion always involves a set of rules. Why not enjoy them?
  type: "16"
- figure: https://source.unsplash.com/random/100x100
  caption: There was ample evidence that a strange man had been present in the room, and the police theory is that that the murderer accompanied his victim to her house. None of the other residents of the quiet residential street saw him arrive, or leave after his bloody business was completed.
  title: MASKS
  subtitle: Architecture simulates and dissimulates.
