  title: If the architect does not want to become unnecessary, the architect will have to <br /> design the crown of the city.
  figure: /assets/graphics/glashaus.png
  caption: "“Important! Important!” This damned importance! Grave-stone and graveyard façades imposed on four-level junk shops and haggle-shacks. Smash those shell-lime columns in Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. Blast those dollhouse mock-ups! Down with all that respectability of sandstone and mirror glass. Smash into smithereens that marble and noblewood! To the garbage dump with all that junk."
  subtitle: To view architecture as nothing more than nicely-designed functional forms or as ornamental wrappings around our essential needs is to assign it the role of a craft and places too little value on its importance in our lives.

  title: To genuinely break away from architecture, you may even need to be murdered.
  figure: /assets/graphics/frame15.jpg
  caption: Architecture is defined by the actions it witnesses as much as by the enclosure of its walls. Building a building differs from the making of buildings in the same way as scaling a building for your life differs from being thrown off one. Menacingly.

  title: To really appreciate architecture, you may even need to commit <br /> a murder.
  figure: https://source.unsplash.com/user/europeana/500x500?1
  caption: Architecture is defined by the actions it witnesses as much as by the enclosure of its walls. Murder in the Street differs from Murder in the Cathedral in the same way as love in the street differs from the Street of Love. Radically.

  title: Sensuality has been known to overcome even the most rational of buildings.
  figure: https://source.unsplash.com/user/europeana/600x500?1
  caption: Architecture is the ultimate erotic act. Carry it to excess and it will reveal both the traces of reason and the sensual experience of space. Simultaneously.

  title: The most architectural thing about this building is the state of decay in which it is.
  figure: https://source.unsplash.com/user/europeana/600x500?2
  caption: Architecture only survives where it negates the form that society expects of it. <br /> Where it negates itself by transgressing the limits that history has set for it.

  caption: "Look at it this way: <br /><br /> The game of architecture is an intricate play with rules that you may break or accept. <br /> These rules, like so many knots that cannot <br /> be untied, have the erotic significance of bondage: the more numerous and sophisticated the restraints, the greater the pleasure."

  figure: https://source.unsplash.com/user/europeana/500x500?2
  caption: There was ample evidence that a strange man had been present in the room, and the police theory is that that the murderer accompanied his victim to her house. None of the other residents of the quiet residential street saw him arrive, or leave after his bloody business was completed.

  title: A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE
  figure: https://source.unsplash.com/user/europeana/400x300?1
  caption: scene Kim Hunter had when she was responding to Brando calling her from the bottom of the stairs. They said it was a moment of orgasm, which only shows that the priests who are the censors don't know anything about orgasm, don't know anything about any kind of relationship between the sexes. It was nothing, it was just that she excited by him, she was excited by his need for her, she heard his voice desiring her, and she responded to it. That's all it was, it was a perfectly natural thing.
  subtitle: It is not the clash between fragments of architecture that counts, but the invisible movement between them. Desire.

  subtitle: If you want to follow architecture's first rule, break it.
  rText: Transgression. <br /> An exquisitely perverse act that never lasts. <br /> And like a caress is <br /> almost impossible to resist.
